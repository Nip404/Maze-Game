# Maze-Game
A graphical maze generator and solver in Python 3.x using the Pygame library.

The algorithm used to generate it is the [Recursive Backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker), which creates a perfect maze.

# Todo
- Implement [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), which traverses a known grid of weighted nodes according to a [heuristic function](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html).

# Requirements
I am using the [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) IDLE.\
Python 3.x and Pygame 1.7.x or above is required.\
You can download pygame either [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml), [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/) or [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame).
