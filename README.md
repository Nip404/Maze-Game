# Maze-Generator
A graphical maze generator in Python 3.x using the Pygame library.

The algorithm used is the [Recursive Backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker).

I am planning to implement the A* algorithm to solve the mazes.

# Shortcuts
- Press any key to reset the maze.
- Click to change the drawing mode.

# Requirements
I am using the [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) IDLE.\
Download project and run main.py to use.\
Python 3.x and Pygame 1.7.x or above is required.\
You can download pygame either [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) or [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/).
