# Maze-Generator
A graphical maze generator in Python 3.x using the Pygame library.

The algorithm used is the [Recursive Backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker).\
I am planning to implement the [Wall follower algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm#Wall_follower) to solve the mazes, as the algorithm creates a perfect maze.

# Shortcuts
- Press any key to reset the maze.
- Click to change the drawing mode.

# Requirements
I am using the [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) IDLE.\
Download project and run main.py to use.\
Python 3.x and Pygame 1.7.x or above is required.\
You can download pygame either [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) or [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/).
